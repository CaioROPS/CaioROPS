#### 📫 &nbsp;About me

Hello! My name is Caio Ricardo, a 99'er with a strong passion for technology, quality, and problem-solving. My journey began in the industrial sector, where I spent seven years working in metallurgical companies within the automotive industry. This experience shaped my analytical mindset, precision, and ability to thrive in high-performance environments—skills that seamlessly translated into my role as a QA.

Transitioning into the world of software quality, I found my true calling in ensuring robust and efficient software through functional, exploratory, and automated testing. I specialize in automation using Cypress and JavaScript, API testing with Postman, and regression testing with tools like LambdaTest. Additionally, I work extensively with Azure DevOps and Jira (Zephyr) to manage test cases, track issues, and streamline workflows.

Beyond my role as a QA, I’m deeply passionate about mentoring and career coaching. As the founder of Maestria do QA, I’ve helped aspiring QAs navigate career transitions, optimize their learning paths, and land their first jobs in tech. I believe that knowledge-sharing and community-driven growth are key to shaping the future of software quality.

Every challenge I encounter is an opportunity to learn and improve. Whether it’s refining test strategies, mentoring new professionals, or enhancing software quality, I’m driven by continuous growth and the impact I can create. The journey is just getting started, and I’m excited for what’s ahead!
